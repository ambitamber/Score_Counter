# Score Counter Sample App

Keeps track of basketball scores for two teams. Used in the Udacity Android for Beginners course.


This is my first Android App made using Andriod Studio. With this, I develop knowleadge in Java and XML. 
I also learned how to use Android Studio. I used log message and toast messages to troubleshoot within the app.
While developing this app, I had foundation on gradle and change dependencies. 

## Getting Started
This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the "gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
